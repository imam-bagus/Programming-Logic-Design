# Shipping Charges

# Case

The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:

Weight of Package = Rate per Pound
2 pounds or less = $1.10
Over 2 pounds but not more than 6 pounds = $2.20
Over 6 pounds but not more than 10 pounds = $3.70
Over 10 pounds = $3.80

Design a program that asks the user to enter the weight of a package and then displays the shipping charges.
