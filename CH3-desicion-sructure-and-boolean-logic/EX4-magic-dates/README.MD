# Magic Dates

## Case

The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the month times the day equals the year:

6/10/60

Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic
