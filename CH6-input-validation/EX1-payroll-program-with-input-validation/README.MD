# Payroll Program with Input Validation

## Case

Design a payroll program that prompts the user to enter an employee’s hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Validate the user’s input so that only pay rates in the range of $7.50 through $18.25 and hours in the range of 0 through 40 are accepted. The program should display the employee’s gross pay.
