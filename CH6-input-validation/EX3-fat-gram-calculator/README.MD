Design a program that asks for the number of fat grams and calories in a food item. Validate the input as follows:

- Make sure the number of fat grams and calories is not less than 0.
- According to nutritional formulas, the number of calories cannot exceed fat grams × 9. Make sure that the number of calories entered is not greater than fat grams × 9.

Once correct data has been entered, the program should calculate and display the percentage of calories that come from fat. Use the following formula:

Percentage of calories from fat = (Fat grams × 9) ÷ Calories

Some nutritionists classify a food as “low fat” if less than 30 percent of its calories come from fat. If the results of this formula are less than 0.3, the program should display a message indicating the food is low in fat.
