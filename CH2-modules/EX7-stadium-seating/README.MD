# Stadium Seating

## Case

There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Design a modular program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.
