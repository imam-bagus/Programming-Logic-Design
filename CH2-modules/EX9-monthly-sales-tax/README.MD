# Monthly Sales Tax program

## Case

A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month, and the amount of state and county sales tax collected.

The state sales tax rate is 4 percent and the county sales tax rate is 2 percent.

Design a modular program that asks the user to enter the total sales for the month.

From this figure, the application should calculate and display the following:

- The amount of county sales tax
- The amount of state sales tax
- The total sales tax (county plus state)

represent the county tax rate (0.02) and the state tax rate (0.04) as named constants.
