# Miles Per Gallon Program

## Case

A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:

- MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used.

Design a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used. It should calculate the car’s miles-per-gallon and display the result on the screen
