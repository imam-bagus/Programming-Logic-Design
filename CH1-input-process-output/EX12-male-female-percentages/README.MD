# Male and Female Percentages

## Case

Design a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females in the class.

Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 รท 20 = 0.4, or 40%. The percentage of females can be calculated as 12 รท 20 = 0.6, or 60%.
