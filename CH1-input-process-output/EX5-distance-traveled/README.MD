# Distance Traveled program

## Case

Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:

- Distance = Speed Ã— Time

A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Design a program that displays the following:

- The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
- The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
- The distance the car will travel in 12 hours

## Pseudocode

```
Declare Integer distance
Declare Integer speed
Declare Integer time

Output "Enter a time :"
Input time

Set distance = speed * time

Output "Distance the car travel in", time, " hours is : ", distance

```
