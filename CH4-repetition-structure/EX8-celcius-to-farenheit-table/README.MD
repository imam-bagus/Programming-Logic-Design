# Celcius to farenheit Table

## Case

Design a program that displays a table of the Celsius temperatures 0 through 20 and their Fahrenheit equivalents. The formula for converting a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is

F = C \* 9/5 + 32

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. Your program must use a loop to display the table.
