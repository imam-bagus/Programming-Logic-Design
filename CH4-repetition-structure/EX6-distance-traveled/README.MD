# Distance Traveled

# case

The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed Ã— Time

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. Design a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period.
