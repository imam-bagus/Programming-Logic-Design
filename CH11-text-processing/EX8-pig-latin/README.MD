# pig latin

## Case

Design a program that reads a sentence as input and converts each word to “Pig Latin.” In one version of Pig Latin you convert a word by removing the first letter, placing that letter at the end of the word, and then appending “ay” to the word.

Here is an example:
English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
