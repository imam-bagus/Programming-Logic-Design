# Prime Numbers

## Case

A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Design a Boolean function named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and returns True if the argument is a prime number, or False otherwise.

Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then displays a message indicating whether the number is prime
