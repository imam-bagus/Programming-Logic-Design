# Falling Distance

## Case

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:

d = (0.5) \* g \* t^2

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Design a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument.

The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval.

Design a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
