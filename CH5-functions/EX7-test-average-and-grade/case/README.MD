# Test Average and Grade

## Case

Write a program that asks the user to enter five test scores. The program should display a letter grade for each score and the average test score. Design the following functions in the program:

- ( calcAverage ) This function should accept five test scores as arguments and return the average of the scores.

- ( determineGrade ) This function should accept a test score as an argument and return a letter grade for the score (as a String), based on the following grading scale:

Score = Letter Grade
90 - 100 = A
80 - 89 = B
70 - 79 = C
60 - 69 = D
Below 60 = F
